This is a personal project to build a machine that can sort Magic the Gathering cards autoatically.
We both have considerably sized collections of cards, roughly a few thousand each, and sorting them by hand takes quite a bit of time.
Ideally a device could sort cards by a user given criteria to automate the process.

Identifying the challenges of sorting cards:

1. Card sorting is time consuming, and they can be sorted by many different criteria which may not work well with each card type
2. Knowing what cards are in a collection is difficult without searching after organization; finding 1 card among thousands can be difficult
3. New cards are added often, and may change the organization of other cards.

A potential automatic solution likely would need to run on a logic controller, like a Raspberry Pi, because it would have to be able to
differentiate cards based on visual information. By design each card is nearly identical, except for the print of the card
on it's front face. Therefore a visual recognition would likely be necessary.

Differentiating factors between cards include:
1. Card Name
2. Card type
3. Card color
4. Card print set
5. Card print rarity
6. Card's artist
7. Card price

If a logic controller can identify these criteria, the cards can be sorted. Ideally the sorting would be done automatically by
the system visually identifying the cards, then physically separating them without user input.

Many of the criteria above have more than 2 different options, so complexity is a factor.
In order to sort the cards automatically, the cards will have to be put into different piles, likely by an actuator
with the number of plies available being the level of differentiation.

After the cards are sorted, the micro controller likely identified each card. In this case, the process of sorting can also
catalog the cards in a person's collection. Part of managing a collection is recognizing if a card is in stock, essentially
killing two birds with one stone with this process.

In the end, the ideal design can:

1. Identify a card
2. Physically sort said card depending upon user defined logic
3. Catalog cards seen into a dataframe or other data object
